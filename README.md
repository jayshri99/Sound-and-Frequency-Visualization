# Sound-and-Frequency-Visualization

Emotions are a vital part of communication in our daily lives. It helps us let others know how we feel about different things, what we want, etc. We want to know how we can recognize the difference between emotions and see if we can find any patterns.

The audience for this visualization would be academic researchers or students to help them improve language learning or speech therapy. Teachers in grade school and in foreign language may also find this helpful to help individuals with speech disorders or non-native speakers who struggle with emotional nuances of a new language. Actors would also benefit from this to improve how they convey emotion on the big screen.
